I have implemented a modular and extendable neural network package in Pharo. This is the first implementation of a neural network in Pharo, capable of digit recognition. It is proved experimentaly that the neural networks created with this package are capable of classifying the handwritten digits of MNIST dataset with 92\% accuracy. Which is exactly the same as the simplest one-layer softmax model created with TensorFlow. Hovewer, the speed of learning appears to be about 180 times lower than the one on TensorFlow. This can be explained by the fact that the latter is parallelized on multiple CPU cores and also uses a GPU for the most time-consuming operations, while the virtual machine of Pharo can only run on a single CPU core. This slow performance demonstrates the need in parallelization and native boost of some operations. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the best and the easiest solution for implementing neural networks in Pharo that could find real-life applications (especially deep networks with more than one hidden layer of neurons) would be by creating the bindings for TensorFlow or any other open-source library of that type.

This work demonstrates the capabilities of Pharo in the field on machine learning and artificial intelligence. It layed a foundation for several other project that would bring us closer to having a full-scale machine learning toolkit implemented in Pharo.
