The best things about object-oriented programming are flexibility, extendability and reusability. The field of neural networks is a very wide, complicated, and continuously growing. It requires different methods, state-of-the-art solutions, and various heuristics. Building a flexible neural networks framework and a modeling tool that would allow you to extend and modify it based on your specific problem, is a good task for OOP.

In this work I will describe my implementation of neural networks in Pharo in an object-oriented manner. One important think to note is that I do not claim to offer any new approach to building neural networks. This field has been well studied long before I got introduced to it. The main goal of this project is to bring neural networks to Smalltalk. To show how this beautiful language can be used for the problems of machine learning and data analysis. And to make my contribution into something that may later become a full-scale machine learning toolkit.
