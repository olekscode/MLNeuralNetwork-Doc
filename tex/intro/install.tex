To use my library you must first install Pharo. It is available for all major operating systems

\subsection{Getting Pharo}
Pharo is a modern, open-source, dynamically typed language supporting live coding and inspired by Smalltalk. The important principle behind Pharo is that it doesnâ€™t just copy the past, but reinvents the essence behind Smalltalk. Pharo is not read-only, it integrates the changes made by community, daily\cite{PBE2}.

To download Pharo, visit the official website: \url{http://pharo.org/download}.

\subsection{Getting the code}
The code of this project can be acquired from Smalltalkhub using this Metacello script (\texttt{Do It} in a Playground of your Pharo image):

\begin{lstlisting}
Metacello new 
    repository: 'http://smalltalkhub.com/mc/Oleks/NeuralNetwork/main';
    configuration: 'MLNeuralNetwork';
    version: #development;
    load.
\end{lstlisting}

Or you can get it from the GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/olekscode/MLNeuralNetwork}. In future this project will be moved to GitHub.

Parts of this project depend on the following packages. They will be automatically installed and updated by Metacello.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{PolyMath} - a library for numerical methods. It provides MATLAB-like vectors and matrices. It is simmilar to numpy library in Python.
  \item \textbf{Roassal} - a library for agile visualizations. The only part dependent on Roassal is MLVisualizer class. All data and metrics are provided in a type that is supported either by Pharo base, or by PolyMath. So if you wish to use something other visualization tool - you are free to do that. However, all examples in this [thesis] will be visualised with MLVisualizer which uses Roassal.
  \item \textbf{IdxReader} - a package for reading the data in idx format, designed by [Guilermo Polito]. The MLDataReader class uses it to read the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. If you don't want to use this dataset - you can ignore this dependency. Everything else will work just fine.
\end{itemize}
