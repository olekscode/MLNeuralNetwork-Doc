In 1995 Barry Ellingsen developed MANN (Modular Artificial Neural Network) system and described it in a technical report \textit{An Object-Oriented Approach to Neural Networks}\cite{Ellingsen-1995}. I took some inspiration from his work, but my implementation was also infuenced by modern packages, such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn.

There were several attempts of implementing neural networks in Pharo. The most notable one would be the work of Alexandre Bergel done in his package
