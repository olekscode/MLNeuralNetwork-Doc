Pharo is a modern, open-source, dynamically typed language supporting live coding and inspired by Smalltalk.

The important principle behind Pharo is that it doesnâ€™t just copy the past, but reinvents the essence behind Smalltalk.

Pharo is not read-only, it integrates the changes made by community, daily. [By now it has more than a hundred contributors] \cite{PBE2}.
