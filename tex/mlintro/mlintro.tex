In this chapter I will provide the reader with the basic understanding of the concept of neural networks and the surrounding field. We will look at the general topic of machine learning, explain the place of neural networks as machine learning algorithms, explore different types of neural network architectures and so on. When it comes to OOP, it is very important to understand the entity that we are trying to represent in our code on a deep level. We must know what exactly is, and what isn’t a neural network, what are the different types of networks, how are they different. What is the relation between a neural network and a neuron? Finally, when it comes to weights, are they properties of a neuron, or of a whole network? If it’s neuron, then which neuron should store these weights, the one that receives the signal, or the one that emits it?
